Tom Froese is a faculty member of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), at the Department of Computer Science in the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Systems Research (IIMAS).

He is also a member of the Center for the Sciences of Complexity (C3) and coordinator of the 4E Cognition Group.

He is interested in the dynamics of ritual practice, especially in the role of extreme rituals in the emergence of cognitive modernity (e.g. Froese et al. 2013; Woodward et al. 2015) and in the role of community ritual as a driver of early sociocultural complexity (e.g. Froese et al. 2014).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodward, A., Froese, T., & Ikegami, T. (2015). Neural coordination can be enhanced by occasional interruption of normal firing patterns: A self-optimizing spiking neural network model. *Neural Networks*, 62, 39-46
